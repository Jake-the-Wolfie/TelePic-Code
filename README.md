# TelePic-Code
This is code that can be used to help set up a game of Telephone Pictionary.
You will need a text file of the player's names, with each player's name on one line. In addition, you will need a text file of what each chain's name should be, also with each chain's name on one line. Both of these lists should be the same length.
The player list should be named playerlist.txt
The chain list should be named chainlist.txt

If you are exporting this, you will probably be posting it to the mafiascum wiki. If you are not, get in touch with me.
All you need for exporting is the finished spreadsheet file, which should be a .csv
The spreadsheet's name should be chainsheet.csv
