# TelePic-Code
This is code that can be used to help set up a game of Telephone Pictionary.

## Importing
For importing, you will need a text file of the player's names, with each player's name on one line. In addition, you will need a text file of what each chain's name should be, also with each chain's name on one line. Both of these lists should be the same length.

There are two variables, **players** and **chainlength**. 
  **players** should be equal to how many players are playing. 
  **chainlength** should be equal to how long you want each chain to be.
  **players** should be greater than or equal to **chainlength**.
  
The player list should be named *playerlist.txt*.
The chain list should be named *chainlist.txt*.

## Exporting

If you are exporting this, you will probably be posting it to the mafiascum wiki. If you are not, get in touch with me, because this code **will not work**.
All you need for exporting is the finished spreadsheet file, which should be a .csv

There are two variables, **players** and **chainlength**. 
  **players** should be equal to how many players are playing. 
  **chainlength** should be equal to how long you want each chain to be.
  **players** should be greater than or equal to **chainlength**.
  
There are two lists, **chainexclude** and **chaininclude**.
  **chainexclude** should contain all the pages you'd like to exclude when exporting.
  **chaininclude** should contain all the pages you'd like to include when exporting.
  If you include any pages in 'chaininclude', then anything you enter into **chainexclude** will be ingnored.
  
The spreadsheet's name should be *chainsheet.csv*.

***WARNING***: Exporting is NOT finished! The code will not work if you attempt to use it.
